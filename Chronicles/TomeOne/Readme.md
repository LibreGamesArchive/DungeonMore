After finishing Ogazuhl game using Godot engine I feel like it the engine is good for making a 3D dungeon crawler. 
Thus, the DungeonMore project is getting its own showcase game, which I will call "Dungeonmore Chronicles". 
I will start working on the first chapter or Tome, rather. Building on what I have learned about Godot Game engine and the resources created 
for Dungeonmore.
